# Fitness_Agent
## 📌 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced world, individuals struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to a lack of personalized guidance, time constraints, and inconsistent motivation. Traditional fitness solutions often require expensive subscriptions, in-person consultations, or rigid routines that don’t adapt to the user's needs. There's a growing demand for an accessible and intelligent virtual assistant that provides real-time fitness and wellness advice tailored to individual goals and preferences.
